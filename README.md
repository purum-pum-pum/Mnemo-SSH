# About Code

prime q - prime_q or just q
prime p - prime_p or just p
private exponent - exp_d or just d
### rsa_gen

Here I generate rsa, from two primes

I choosed the easiest way to generate priv exponent **(d)**, so I use formula. WHer **(k)** is random integer that make our **(d)** integer, not float. So I'm just bruteforce this number. Another way is using Evglid algorithm and Bezout's ratio. But it is algorithm, it harder. I choosed formula, it is from school, take formula insert numbers and count
