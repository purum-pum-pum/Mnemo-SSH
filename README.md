### rsa_gen

Here I generate rsa, from two primes

I choosed the easiest way to generate priv exponent*(d)*, so I use formula. WHer *(k)* is random integer that make our *(d)* integer, not float. So I'm just bruteforce this number. Another way is using Evglid algorithm and Bezout's ratio. But it is algorithm, it harder. I choosed formula, it is from school, take formula insert numbers and count
